# Welcome!
## Intro
Hi, my name is Uhlan Larrie, and welcome to my development profile on Github! Here I showcase my projects, different programming problem solutions, and my general progress in learning certain things like programming languages or data structures.

I am currently not in school, though I do have one school project uploaded: my FEDD(First-Yaar Engineering Design Day) Project where I designed a game using Game Maker. I worked in a team of three, my role being the lead programmer(only because no one else knew how to program or cared to learn so I ended up writing the whole game--good experience at least), to design an educational computer game. I suggested nuclear fusion as a topic(as it was something I was extremely passionate about at the time--and still am, though, less so), and, thus, the game. While it's not my best work and was written about three years ago, I feel it's important to show.  

Feel free to explore and hope you leave with something!

**Note:** _Several ideas and projects I am working on, both development and non-development related, are mentioned here, but are not on this repository as this is a public repository and I have numerous ideas and projects that have nothing to do with development._
